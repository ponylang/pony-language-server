## Fix textDocumentSync server capability

Previously the `textDocumentSync` property was malformed and not according to spec.
It seemed vscode did the right thing and fell back to sending both `didChange` and `didSave` notifications anyways.
Neovim didn't, so we didn't receive any `didSave` notifications. Now everything is working as expected with neovim and vscode.
