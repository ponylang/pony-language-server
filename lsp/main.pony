## The Pony Language Server

This package implements the (Language Server Protocol Spec
v3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
for Pony.

It is using the `ast` library to parse and type-check pony projects opened in
the editor, using the same code as the official compiler `ponyc`, so the
diagnostics and code analysis provided will always be in sync with what the
`ponyc` compiler provides.

## Package Contents

### `lsp`

This package contains all the code supporting the protocol, data structures and types from the spec, the communication
with a language client. The [`LanguageServer`](lsp-LanguageServer.md) is
controlling which requests and notifications are supported and dispatches to the
actor handling the workspace for the given request.

- [`Channel`](lsp-Channel.md) defining the necessary channel behaviours and [`Stdio`](lsp-Stdio.md) being the implementation for Standard-IO based communication.
- [`PonyCompiler`](lsp-PonyCompiler.md) as an actor whose main job is to expose
  the `ast` lib functionality of parsing and typechecking a pony project and to
  linearize all requests as the underlying libponyc is not 100% thread-safe.

### `lsp/workspace`

This package contains the actual logic applied to handling a single pony
project. The [`WorkspaceManager`](lsp-workspace-WorkspaceManager.md) actor handles
requests and notifications, starts the parsing and typechecking process and
receives its results. It builds up the necessary state needed for answering LSP
client requests in the [`PackageState`](lsp-workspace-PackageState.md) and
[`DocumentState`](lsp-workspace-DocumentState.md) classes.
